# mindustry-88x88-imagegenerator
88x88 image generator for Mindustry processors

How to make an image:

1. Download Python, if you haven't already (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run "pip install keyboard" and "pip install clipboard" in shell (only tested on windows)
3. Download and run the script
4. Choose an image (has to be located in same folder as script)
5. Copy the schematic.txt into schematic menu in game, then build the schematic
6. After commands are generated, open game and start copying the commands in empty processors
7. Every time you press escape, new code will be copied in your clipboard
8. Turn on the switch to start drawing!
(Only tested on square images. I do not know what happens otherwise. Maybe it will stretch, maybe just resize to fit in, maybe not.)
